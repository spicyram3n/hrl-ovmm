class SceneGraph:
    """
    Represents a scene graph to manage and organize connections between nodes in a 3D scene.

    The SceneGraph class is designed to structure relationships between various nodes
    in a 3D scene, maintaining connectivity, labels, and hierarchical relationships, also
    during transformations applied to the scene/nodes. 
    It supports efficient queries and manages node attributes.

    Attributes:
        index (int): Counter to keep track of unique indices for nodes in the scene graph.
        nodes (dict): Dictionary to store nodes in the scene graph, keyed by unique node IDs.
        labels (dict): Mapping of node IDs to semantic labels.
        outgoing (dict): Tracks outgoing connections for each node, representing directed edges.
        ingoing (dict): Tracks ingoing connections for each node, representing directed edges, mutiple ingoing connections are possible.
        tree (Optional[spatial.KDTree]): KDTree for efficient spatial queries, if applicable.
        ids (list): List of node IDs present in the scene graph, is updated after addition or deletion of nodes.
        k (int): Number of nearest neighbors to consider for spatial relations. Defaults to 2.
        label_mapping (dict): Dictionary for mapping semantic labels.
        min_confidence (float): Minimum confidence threshold for including nodes in the scene.
        immovable (list): List of IDs or labels representing nodes that cannot be moved.
        pose (Optional[np.ndarray]): Pose of the entire scene graph, if applicable.
        mesh (Optional[o3d.geometry.TriangleMesh]): Central mesh representation of the scene, if applicable.
        pcd (Optional[o3d.geometry.PointCloud]): Central point cloud representation of the scene, if applicable.
